'''Some packages wn't be availabe with the pip
install command, so to rectify this issue, go to
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
(saved in bookmarks of eedge as pythonpackagessite)
Download the wld file
say our wld file is downloaded in our python learning
folder on desktop
So,
1)Open cmd prompt
2)goto the python learning folder using cd and
path description(or go where the file is downloaded)
3)Write the command
C:/Python34/Scripts/pip install "file name"
(just type the initials of file name and hit tab)
in my casr , most probably instead of Python34,
use Anaconda3(justcopy the address by going to
the folder)
